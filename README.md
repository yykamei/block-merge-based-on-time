# Block Merge Based on Time

Some organizations have the policy to prohibit their members from merging pull requests because it would be difficult to
handle troubles after working hours or on holidays. This action helps them to ensure such a policy in enforcement.

Block Merge Based on Time
[creates a commit status](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-commit-status) for each pull request
head commit. If the time is during **blocking**, it creates a commit status with **pending**. On the other hand, it
creates a commit status with **success** while it's not the time to block. You can circumvent this block with a specific
label named `no-block` by default. This might be useful when you have to merge pull requests because of an emergency or
irregular maintenance.

## Usage

Create a new workflow like this:

```yaml
name: Block Merge Based on Time
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
      - reopened
      - labeled
  schedule:
    - cron: "*/30 * * * *"

jobs:
  block:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: yykamei/block-merge-based-on-time@main
        with:
          after: 17:30
          before: 09:00
          timezone: Pacific/Honolulu
          prohibited-days-dates: "Sunday, 2021-10-01, 2021-12-29/2022-01-04"
```
